        <h2 class="article-title">Student Learns HTML</h2>
        <p class="article-text">
          Once upon a time, there was a student who decided to learn HTML. At
          first, they thought it was easy as pie. But soon they realized that
          HTML was trickier than a fox in a henhouse. The student spent hours
          trying to figure out why their code was broken, only to find out that
          they had misspelled a tag. It was as if the HTML gods were playing a
          prank on them. But the student persisted, like a warrior fighting a
          dragon. They learned to conquer HTML, and even started to think in
          tags. Now, they're a coding ninja, ready to take on the world one web
          page at a time.
        </p>
        <p class="article-text">
          One day, the student proudly showed their newly acquired HTML skills
          to a friend. But the friend just scoffed and said, "That's so 90s.
          Nowadays, you need to learn React to be cool." The student's heart
          sank like a stone. Had they wasted all that time learning an outdated
          technology? But then, they had a moment of clarity. HTML was like an
          old, reliable car that may not have all the bells and whistles of a
          fancy new model, but still gets you where you need to go. And besides,
          who wants to be cool when you can be classic? The student smiled,
          knowing that they had learned something valuable and timeless.

        <h2 class="article-title">CSS Is Apparently a Thing</h2>
        <p class="article-text">
          In a shocking turn of events, it has been revealed that CSS is
          apparently a thing. Yes, you heard that right - CSS, that mysterious
          language that web developers use to make websites look pretty,
          actually exists. Experts speculate that CSS has been around for
          decades, but it's only now that the general public has become aware of
          its existence. In related news, unicorns and leprechauns have also
          been confirmed as things, much to the surprise of skeptics everywhere.
        </p>
        <p class="article-text">
          Rumors are swirling that CSS may even have magical powers. Some say
          that it can turn a boring website into a work of art, while others
          claim that it can make cats dance on your screen (okay, maybe not that
          last one). Regardless, the discovery of CSS has sent shockwaves
          through the internet, with users everywhere scrambling to learn this
          mysterious language. So if you're feeling left behind, fear not - CSS
          is apparently a thing, and who knows what other hidden wonders the
          internet has in store for us.

          I thought farming was boring until I played Stardew Valley. Now, I
          can't stop tending to my virtual crops, animals, and spouse. I've even
          named my chickens after my real-life friends (don't tell them). The
          only problem? My actual farm is in shambles because I've been too busy
          playing. Whoops!

          java, as long as you share it with your feline companion (in
          moderation, of course). Just be prepared for some jealous stares and
          maybe a paw in your cup. Cheers to coffee, tea, and cats - the true
